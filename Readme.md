Note: Everything in this book is for gtk 2.* and does not cover 3.*.  This book is no longer being actively maintained as most of my work now is with mono and .net.  Further development has been moved to https://github.com/majorsilence/pygtknotebook in case anyone would like to continue working on it.

I have decided to collect all of my notes and sample files as a book so I have one location to turn to when I want to remember how to do something.  Basically I am using open source code to write an open source book.  At the moment there is not much and it is only a very rough draft.  There are many empty sections and many of my sources probably are not cited properly yet. Hopefully some day it will be in good shape.

My goal is to create a high quality PyGTK book that covers integrating PyGTK with other Linux technologies such as: GStreamer multimedia, clutter animation, cairo graphics, DBus interprocess communication, empathy instant messaging, webkit and embedded firefox.  This is just a small sample of the things that I want to cover, and many of them I already do.  However, this is only an incomplete first draft and will take time to finish, but I am putting it on the Internet now hoping it will be useful to someone other then myself.

I am currently writing this using lyx which is a GUI tool for latex.  I find this a very easy to use tool and convenient for myself.
